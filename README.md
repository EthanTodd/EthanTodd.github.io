README for tic.tac.toe.

First project due for General Assembly. 2015.



This is a two player tic tac toe game.

Tic tac toe is a game that consists of a board that includes 9 boxes. The board set up is 3 boxes by 3 boxes. A winner is declared once a player marks 3 boxes in a row. This can be achieved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Player names can be chosen by clicking the "new game" button. A rematch can be chosen once a winner is declared. Scores will continue to tally until the page is reloaded or a rematch is no longer selected.

This project was completed and uploaded to GitHub.

This is the first version of this game.
